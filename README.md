Heart-rate estimation with CNN-LSTM networks

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are two types of deep learning networks that have been shown to be effective for heart rate estimation. CNNs are good at extracting spatial features from data, while LSTMs are good at modeling temporal dependencies.

A CNN-LSTM network for heart rate estimation typically consists of the following components:

Input layer: This layer accepts the input data, which can be PPG signals, facial video, or other physiological signals.
CNN layers: These layers extract spatial features from the input data.
LSTM layers: These layers model the temporal dependencies in the extracted features.
Output layer: This layer predicts the heart rate based on the output of the LSTM layers.
CNN-LSTM networks have been shown to achieve high accuracy for heart rate estimation, even in challenging conditions such as during exercise or when there is motion artifact.

Here are some examples of how CNN-LSTM networks have been used for heart rate estimation:

PPG-based heart rate estimation: CNN-LSTM networks have been used to estimate heart rate from PPG signals, which are non-invasive optical signals that can be measured from the wrist or fingertip. This approach has been shown to be effective for both resting and active heart rate estimation.
Video-based heart rate estimation: CNN-LSTM networks have also been used to estimate heart rate from facial video. This approach has the advantage of being non-contact and not requiring any wearable devices.
Fetal heart rate estimation: CNN-LSTM networks have also been used to estimate fetal heart rate from abdominal ECG signals. This approach can be used to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy and labor.
Overall, CNN-LSTM networks are a promising approach for heart rate estimation. They have been shown to achieve high accuracy in a variety of settings, including during exercise and when there is motion artifact.

Here are some of the advantages of using CNN-LSTM networks for heart rate estimation:

High accuracy: CNN-LSTM networks have been shown to achieve high accuracy for heart rate estimation, even in challenging conditions.
Non-invasive: CNN-LSTM networks can be used to estimate heart rate from non-invasive signals such as PPG and facial video. This makes them suitable for a wider range of applications.
Robust to motion artifact: CNN-LSTM networks are relatively robust to motion artifact, which is a common problem in heart rate estimation.
However, there are also some challenges associated with using CNN-LSTM networks for heart rate estimation:

Computational complexity: CNN-LSTM networks can be computationally expensive to train and deploy.
Data requirements: CNN-LSTM networks require a large amount of training data to achieve high accuracy.
Despite these challenges, CNN-LSTM networks are a promising approach for heart rate estimation with a wide range of potential applications.
