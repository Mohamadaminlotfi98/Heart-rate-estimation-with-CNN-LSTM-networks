Here, I implemented a deep learning model that measures the heart rate of individuals based on their facial expressions. The model first uses convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract the features of ECG signals, and then uses the following LSTM to capture the features of the temporal dimension of the data, which are combined into a CNN-LSTM hybrid model. This has improved the accuracy rate, sensitivity and specificity
